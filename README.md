<h4>About</h4>

Recent PhD graduate at UC Riverside. My dissertation investigated the association between the frequency of Google search terms and area-level mortality. Area-level increases in suicide-related search terms are significantly associated with that area’s suicide rate over a seven-year period. Area-level increases in drug-related search terms are significantly associated with that area’s drug overdose rate over a seven-year period. 

Currently pursuing a career in data analysis/science and health/epidemiology.
